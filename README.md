# 📌 Numerical Analysis Repository

Welcome to the **Numerical Analysis** repository! This repository contains implementations of numerical methods as part of my **Numerical Analysis** subject coursework.

## 📖 About
This repository serves as a collection of numerical methods used to find roots of equations. Currently, it includes the following methods:

- 🔹 **Bisection Method**
- 🔹 **Regula Falsi Method**
- 🔹 **Newton Raphson Method**

Each method is implemented with clear structure and comments to ensure readability and ease of understanding.

## 📂 Repository Structure
```
📦 Numerical-Analysis
 ┣ 📂 Bisection-Method
 ┃ ┣ 📜 bisection_method
 ┃ ┣ 📜 bisection_method.cpp
 ┃ ┣ 📜 bisection_method.exe
 ┣ 📂 Regula-Falsi
 ┃ ┣ 📜 regula_falsi
 ┃ ┣ 📜 regula_falsi.cpp
 ┃ ┣ 📜 regula_falsi.exe
 ┣ 📂 Newton-Raphson
 ┃ ┣ 📜 newton_raphson

 ┣ 📜 README.md
```

## 🛠️ How to Use
To run the numerical methods, simply execute the corresponding executable files:

**Windows:**
```bash
./Bisection-Method/bisection_method.exe
./Regula-Falsi/regula_falsi.exe
./Newton-Raphson/newton_raphson.exe
```

**In Linux:**
```bash
./Bisection-Method/bisection_method
./Regula-Falsi/regula_falsi
./Newton-Raphson/newton_raphson
```

**Note:**
To solve for specific functions, you must edit the source code cand change the functions yourself.

Compile using:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o filename.exe
```

Ensure you have the necessary environment to run compiled C++ programs.

## 📌 Future Additions
✅ More numerical methods such as Secant Method.
✅ Improved visualizations for results.
